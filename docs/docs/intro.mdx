# Introduction

Dewy is a knowledge base built for generative AI that helps you build AI agents and RAG applications by managing the extraction of knowledge from your documents and implementing semantic search over the extracted content.

Load your documents and Dewy takes care of parsing, chunking, summarizing, and indexing for retrieval.
Dewy builds on the lessons of putting real Gen AI applications into production so you can focus on getting ðŸ’© done, rather than comparing vector databases and building data extraction infrastructure.

Below is the typical architecture of an AI agent performing RAG.
Dewy handles all of the parts shown in brown so you can focus on your application -- the parts in green.
